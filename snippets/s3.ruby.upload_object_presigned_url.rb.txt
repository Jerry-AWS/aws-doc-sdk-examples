# Uploads an object to a bucket in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
#   by using a presigned URL.
#
# Prerequisites:
#
# - An S3 bucket.
# - An object in the bucket to upload content to.
#
# @param s3_client [Aws::S3::Resource] An initialized S3 resource.
# @param bucket_name [String] The name of the bucket.
# @param object_key [String] The name of the object.
# @param object_content [String] The content to upload to the object.
# @param http_client [Net::HTTP] An initialized HTTP client.
#   This is especially useful for testing with mock HTTP clients.
#   If not specified, a default HTTP client is created.
# @return [Boolean] true if the object was uploaded; otherwise, false.
# @example
#   exit 1 unless object_uploaded_to_presigned_url?(
#     Aws::S3::Resource.new(region: 'us-east-1'),
#     'doc-example-bucket',
#     'my-file.txt',
#     'This is the content of my-file.txt'
